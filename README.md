# MCA
Week 1
The theme for my data set is the piece Num Komm der Heiden Heiland by Bach. I was origianally set on focusing on a track by my favourite band when it came to my theme, however I really struglled to find downloadable sheet music for this so instead ended up choosing a random song from IMSLP which happened to be this Bach piece. I don't know anything about the composer or his music which I recognise may cause some difficulties along the way, along with the fact I havw no experience of working with sheet music of any kind.
