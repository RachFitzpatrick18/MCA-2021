# MCA
Week 1

Theme: 

The theme for my data set is the piece Num Komm der Heiden Heiland by Bach. I was origianally set on focusing on a track by my favourite band when it came to my theme, however I really struglled to find downloadable sheet music for this so instead ended up choosing a random song from IMSLP which happened to be this Bach piece. I don't know anything about the composer or his music which I recognise may cause some difficulties along the way, along with the fact I have no experience of reading or working with sheet music of any kind.

Current manifestations of data related to theme: 

Descriptive Data - There is descriptive data on Bach and his music available on numerous different websites online. mostly ones which specalise on music of the past and historical accounts of this. This data usually includes information such as dates, conductors and emsebmles etc. Despite being of the classical genre, his music is also available on all major streaming platforms such as spotify or apple music. The data on these platforms is usually organised into their most popular tracks, their albums, compliations and also playlists which their music features on. Spotify in particular also has a feature called 'Radio' in which tracks are recommended to the user based off their current listening activity, again due to stored descriptive data, this is also available to listeners of Bach.

Notated Data - Sheet music is available for the majority of Bach's compositions online, these can be found on websites such as IMSLP.com, where I found the piece I've used as my theme. 

Acoustic Data - Much like the descriptive data, acoustic data can also be found on streaming platforms and sites such as YouTube, housing live tracks and performances of various Bach compositions.

Week 2

For week 2's task I have transcribed Bach's Nun Komm der Heiden Heiland.

Week 3

For week 3's lab we were to export the MuseScore file which we used in the previous week's task and convert this to a MusicXML file, in turn then forming an MEI file. We then had to render the code from the folder on our github titled 'verovio.html' and edit it in order to display our own file. 

Week 4

During week 4's lab we had to generate a JSymbolic analysis of our chosen piece of music. When creating this, these are features which I think are the most interesting and relevant to this piece. We also had to generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of our chosen track.

Week 5

Week 5's lab tasked us to create a basic metadata scheme for our theme and to modify our MEI file based on this.

These are the elements which I believe to be the most important for describing the music in a dataset:

-Title of the peice

-Genre of the piece

-Artist or composer in which the piece is accredited to

-Date of publication

-Source where the transcribed file came from

-File size

Week 7

For week 7's task we had to further the previous week's metadata scheme by adding in information such as the genre, which I already previously added, specific licensing data and any other metadata which we think could be enhanced.

Week 8

As my theme is just one single track, I decided to split it into three seperate smaller sections of the piece in order to complete this weeks task. This is what I believe to be the most important metadata about each track.

We then had to create and export both a spectrogram and waveform of each track, these are displayed below.

An advantage of a time-frequency analysis over a waveform-based analysis would be...

Week 9

For week 9's task I used the same three sections of my piece as last week, and created a Spectrogram, MFCC and Chromagram of each, these are displayed below.

I then created a histogram of the MFCC files in order to analyse the timber of the sections of the piece, which is the qaulity of sound.

Analysis

Week 10

During week 10's lab we had to generate a similarity matrix using the same three tracks as previously used over the past two weeks.

We then had to create a transcription in order to form a comparison analysis. I used my file from week 2 which I then created a wav of through musescore before importing it to sonic visualiser, forming a MIDI file. This transcribed file was then compared to the original file.
